**Flask** web dashboard with integrated **Go TCP port scanner** and **Python Scapy packet sniffer**. Includes user authentication with Admin/User roles and stores results in SQLite.

## ✅ Features

- User registration, login, logout  
- Role-based access control (Admin/User)  
- Execute Go-based TCP port scans from the dashboard  
- Execute Scapy-based packet sniffing from the dashboard  
- View and manage scan/sniff results  
- Admin controls: promote users, delete users, clear or delete results  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python – Flask, Flask-Login, Flask-Bcrypt, Flask-SQLAlchemy  
- Go – standard library for concurrent TCP scanning  
- Scapy – packet capture and parsing  
- SQLite – via SQLAlchemy ORM  
- Bootstrap – UI templates (Jinja2)

## 🚀 Setup & Running

4. Run the app:  
   python app.py  
5. Log in using credentials:
